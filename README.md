# Prediction With Machine Learning
I solve the problem I describe below using my own regression codes with machine learning.

## Problem Definition
PROBLEM: Predict the foreign currency by using the other foreign currencies. 

Code Phase 1: 

- You are supplied with “Doviz_Satislari_20050101_20231205_Training_Set.xlsx” Dataset.
  
- This data set contains 8 different foreign currencies records starting from 03.01.2005 to 28.11.2023.
  
- 7 of them marked as INPUT features to your model.
  
- 1 of them (the last one) marked as OUTPUT of your model.
  
- Write down the code for reading the Training Dataset (inputs and output).
  
- It should be possible to query i.th record of the inputs and related output (ex: print 4512.record on screen)
  
Code Phase 2:

- Write “Cost/Loss” function code
  
- Write “Derivative of Cost/Lost” function code
  
- Write “Optimizer” function code with the codes above

- Write your Model Code to solve the problem
  
Code Phase 3:

- Write Code needed for Preventing Overfitting using the Hybrid L2/L1 Penalty.
  
Code TEST Phase:

- Write Code needed for taking 7 input currencies and give prediction of the output
